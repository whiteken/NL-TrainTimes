<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Post, retrieve and engage with Tweets

.DESCRIPTION
    POST statuses/update_with_media (deprecated)
    
    This endpoint has been DEPRECATED should no longer be used. This endpoint does not support multiple images, animated GIFs, or video. Replacement method: follow the Uploading media guide to upload one or more media entities, and then use POST statuses/update to attach them to a Tweet.
    
    Updates the authenticated user's current status and attaches media for upload. This creates a Tweet with a (single) picture attached.
    
    Unlike POST statuses/update, this method expects raw multipart data. The POST request's content-type should be set to multipart/form-data with the media[] parameter.
    
    The Tweet text will be rewritten to include the media URL(s), which will reduce the number of characters allowed in the Tweet text. If the URL(s) cannot be appended without text truncation, the Tweet will be rejected and this method will return an HTTP 403 error.
    
    Users are limited to a specific daily media upload limit. Requests to this endpoint will return the following headers with information regarding the user's current media upload limits:
    
    x-mediaratelimit-limit - Indicates the total pieces of media the current user may upload before the time indicated in x-mediaratelimit-reset.
    x-mediaratelimit-remaining - The remaining pieces of media the current user may upload before the time indicated in x-mediaratelimit-reset.
    x-mediaratelimit-reset - A UTC-based timestamp (in seconds) indicating when x-mediaratelimit-remaining will reset to the value in x-mediaratelimit-limit and the user can resume uploading media.
    
    If the user is over the daily media limit, this method will return an HTTP 403 error. In addition to media upload limits, the user is also limited in the number of statuses they can publish daily. If the user tries to exceed the number of updates allowed, this method will also return an HTTP 403 error, similar to POST statuses/update.
    
    There is a 30 second timeout for this endpoint, so network latency may prevent media being posted successfully.
    
    OAuth is handled differently for POST messages. See Uploading Media for more details on this.

.PARAMETER status
    The text of your status update. URL encode as necessary. t.co link wrapping may affect character counts if the post contains URLs. You must additionally account for the characters_reserved_per_media per uploaded media, additionally accounting for space characters in between finalized URLs. Note : Request the GET help / configuration &lt;/en/docs/developer-utilities/configuration/api-reference/get-help-c current characters_reserved_per_mediaandmax_media_per_upload` values.
